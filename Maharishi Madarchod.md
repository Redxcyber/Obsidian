Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was born on **12 January 1917** in a small village called **Chichli**, near **Jabalpur** in central India. His birth name was either **Mahesh Verma Shrivastava** or **Mahesh Prasad Varma**. His family belonged to the **Kayastha caste** and followed **Hinduism**.

He completed his **graduation from Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh** and started working as a **physicist**. While studying physics, he became interested in how **sound vibrations from spoken words** can affect a person’s **body and mind**.

Later, he became a **disciple (follower) of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati**, also known as **"Guru Dev"**. Over time, he became **Guru Dev’s personal secretary**. However, due to India's caste system, he was not chosen as Guru Dev’s successor, but he could still become a **spiritual teacher (guru)** on his own. Guru Dev gave him the title **Bal Brahmachari Mahesh**.

Later, he adopted the name **Maharishi** (which means **"great teacher"**), and **"Yogi"** was a title given to yoga teachers.

After Guru Dev passed away in **1953**, Maharishi went to **Uttarkashi in the Himalayas**, where he meditated for **two years**.

- **1955**: After spending time meditating in the **Himalayas**, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi started spreading the meditation techniques he learned from his Guru. This technique was based on **Advaita Vedanta** (a Hindu philosophy). He took the name **Maharishi**, meaning "great soul," and renamed the meditation method **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**.

- **1958**: Maharishi **toured India for two years**. On **January 1, 1958**, he announced the creation of the **Spiritual Regeneration Movement**, a global initiative to spread Transcendental Meditation and bring spiritual growth to people.

- **March 1958**: Maharishi established **25 Spiritual Regeneration Movement centers** across India. Then, he traveled outside India to **Burma (Myanmar), Malaya, Hong Kong, and Hawaii (USA)** to spread his teachings.

- **1959**: He **started his world tour** and spent most of the year in the **United States**. His goal was to introduce **Transcendental Meditation (TM) to the world** over the next three years.

- **1959 (same year)**: He gave lectures and taught TM in cities like **San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and London**.

- **1960**: Maharishi introduced the concept of the **"Maharishi Effect."** He claimed that if **just 1% of a population practiced Transcendental Meditation**, it would create **positive changes in society**, improving people's quality of life. This theory was later **scientifically confirmed in 1976**.

- **April 1961**: Maharishi started the **first Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training Course** in **Rishikesh, India**. **60 people from different countries** joined this course to learn how to teach TM.



- **August 24, 1967**: The **Beatles**, a famous English rock band, attended Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s **lecture in London**. They were very impressed and wanted to meet him personally. Maharishi invited them to **learn Transcendental Meditation (TM)** at a weekend course at **University College, Bangor**.

- **1968**: A year later, **Maharishi invited The Beatles to his ashram in Rishikesh, India**, where they spent **three months** practicing meditation.

- **Other Celebrities**: Apart from **The Beatles**, Maharishi also taught **TM** to many famous people like:

	- **Mike Love** (from The Beach Boys band)
    - **Mia Farrow** (Hollywood actress)
    - **David Lynch** (filmmaker)
- **Mid-1970s**: Maharishi **introduced TM to the business world**. Many people from **Wall Street (financial district in New York)** paid **$1,000** for an intensive meditation course to improve their performance and reduce stress.

- **TM-Sidhi Program & Yogic Flying**: Around the same time, Maharishi introduced the **TM-Sidhi program**, which included **"Yogic Flying."** He described it as the **highest level of meditation**, where people could **sit cross-legged and lift off slightly from soft surfaces like spongy mattresses**.

- **Politics (1992)**: Maharishi **founded a political party called The Natural Law Party (NLP)**. The party was based on his **philosophy of Transcendental Meditation, Indian spirituality, and quantum physics**. It was well-funded and contested **310 seats in the 1992 European Parliamentary elections in Britain**, but it **did not win any seats** and received only **0.19% of the total votes**.


- **Eliminating Poverty (2000)**:  
    Maharishi Mahesh Yogi wanted to **reduce poverty** worldwide. In **2000**, he started a program called the **"Programme to Eliminate Poverty."**
    
    - His idea was to **use unused farmland** and develop it using **Vedic Organic Agriculture** methods.
