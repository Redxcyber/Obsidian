Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was born on **12 January 1917** in a small village called **Chichli**, near **Jabalpur** in central India. His birth name was either **Mahesh Verma Shrivastava** or **Mahesh Prasad Varma**. His family belonged to the **Kayastha caste** and followed **Hinduism**.

He completed his **graduation from Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh** and started working as a **physicist**. While studying physics, he became interested in how **sound vibrations from spoken words** can affect a person’s **body and mind**.

Later, he became a **disciple (follower) of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati**, also known as **"Guru Dev"**. Over time, he became **Guru Dev’s personal secretary**. However, due to India's caste system, he was not chosen as Guru Dev’s successor, but he could still become a **spiritual teacher (guru)** on his own. Guru Dev gave him the title **Bal Brahmachari Mahesh**.

Later, he adopted the name **Maharishi** (which means **"great teacher"**), and **"Yogi"** was a title given to yoga teachers.

After Guru Dev passed away in **1953**, Maharishi went to **Uttarkashi in the Himalayas**, where he meditated for **two years**.

- **1955**: After spending time meditating in the **Himalayas**, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi started spreading the meditation techniques he learned from his Guru. This technique was based on **Advaita Vedanta** (a Hindu philosophy). He took the name **Maharishi**, meaning "great soul," and renamed the meditation method **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**.

- **1958**: Maharishi **toured India for two years**. On **January 1, 1958**, he announced the creation of the **Spiritual Regeneration Movement**, a global initiative to spread Transcendental Meditation and bring spiritual growth to people.

- **March 1958**: Maharishi established **25 Spiritual Regeneration Movement centers** across India. Then, he traveled outside India to **Burma (Myanmar), Malaya, Hong Kong, and Hawaii (USA)** to spread his teachings.

- **1959**: He **started his world tour** and spent most of the year in the **United States**. His goal was to introduce **Transcendental Meditation (TM) to the world** over the next three years.

- **1959 (same year)**: He gave lectures and taught TM in cities like **San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and London**.

- **1960**: Maharishi introduced the concept of the **"Maharishi Effect."** He claimed that if **just 1% of a population practiced Transcendental Meditation**, it would create **positive changes in society**, improving people's quality of life. This theory was later **scientifically confirmed in 1976**.
- **April 1961**: Maharishi started the **first Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training Course** in **Rishikesh, India**. **60 people from different countries** joined this course to learn how to teach TM.
