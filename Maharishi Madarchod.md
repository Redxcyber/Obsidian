Maharishi Mahesh Yogi **(12 January 1917 – 5 February 2008)** was born on **12 January 1917** in a small village called **Chichli**, near **Jabalpur** in central India. His birth name was either **Mahesh Verma Shrivastava** or **Mahesh Prasad Varma**. His family belonged to the **Kayastha caste** and followed **Hinduism**.

He completed his **graduation from Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh** and started working as a **physicist**. While studying physics, he became interested in how **sound vibrations from spoken words** can affect a person’s **body and mind**.

Later, he became a **disciple (follower) of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati**, also known as **"Guru Dev"**. Over time, he became **Guru Dev’s personal secretary**. However, due to India's caste system, he was not chosen as Guru Dev’s successor, but he could still become a **spiritual teacher (guru)** on his own. Guru Dev gave him the title **Bal Brahmachari Mahesh**.

Later, he adopted the name **Maharishi** (which means **"great teacher"**), and **"Yogi"** was a title given to yoga teachers.

After Guru Dev passed away in **1953**, Maharishi went to **Uttarkashi in the Himalayas**, where he meditated for **two years**.

- **1955**: After spending time meditating in the **Himalayas**, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi started spreading the meditation techniques he learned from his Guru.

The party was based on his **philosophy of Transcendental Meditation, Indian spirituality, and quantum physics**.
