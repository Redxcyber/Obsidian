# 🌟 Java Multithreading - Very Detailed Notes

---

## 🔹 1. **What is Multithreading?**

**Multithreading** is a programming concept that allows the execution of two or more parts of a program (called threads) simultaneously.

✅ A **thread** is the smallest unit of a process that can be executed independently.

**Multithreading = Multiple threads running concurrently within the same process.**

> ✅ Example: In a text editor – typing, spell checking, and autosaving can happen in parallel using different threads.

---

## 🔹 2. **Benefits of Multithreading**

- ✔️ Efficient CPU Utilization
    
- ✔️ Simultaneous task execution
    
- ✔️ Better performance for resource-intensive apps
    
- ✔️ Useful for I/O operations (network, file I/O)

## 🔹 3. **Thread vs Process**

|Feature|Process|Thread|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|Independent program in execution|Lightweight sub-part of process|
|Memory|Separate memory per process|Shares memory of process|
|Communication|Complex (IPC needed)|Easy (shared memory)|
|Dependency|Independent|May depend on other threads|

---

## 🔹 4. **Creating Threads in Java**

There are **three main ways**:

### A. **By extending the `Thread` class**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Do not use run()
    }
}
```

### B. **By implementing the `Runnable` interface**

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### C. **Using lambda expressions (Java 8+)**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Lambda thread running");
        });
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

## 🔹 5. **Thread Lifecycle**

A thread has the following states:

1. **New** – Thread created but not started
    
2. **Runnable** – Thread ready to run
    
3. **Running** – Thread currently executing
    
4. **Blocked/Waiting** – Waiting for resource or signal
    
5. **Terminated (Dead)** – Thread has finished execution
    

### Diagram:

```java
New → Runnable → Running → Terminated
           ↘
          Waiting / Blocked
           ↘
         Runnable
```

---

## 🔹 6. **Common Thread Methods**

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|`start()`|Starts a thread|
|`run()`|Code executed by the thread|
|`sleep(ms)`|Pauses execution for milliseconds|
|`join()`|Waits for thread to finish|
|`isAlive()`|Checks if thread is still alive|
|`getName()`|Gets thread name|
|`setName()`|Sets thread name|
|`setPriority(int)`|Sets priority (1–10)|

---

## 🔹 7. **Thread Priority**

- `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY = 1`
    
- `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5`
    
- `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY = 10`
    

But actual execution depends on OS thread scheduler.

---

## 🔹 8. **Thread Synchronization**

When **multiple threads** access shared data, inconsistency may occur. This is called a **race condition**.

### 🔐 `synchronized` Keyword:

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

### Ways to Synchronize:

- **Synchronized method**
    
- **Synchronized block**:
    

```java
synchronized(obj) {
    // code
}
```

---

## 🔹 9. **Inter-thread Communication**

Allows threads to **communicate and cooperate** with each other.

### Methods from `Object` class:

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|`wait()`|Releases lock and waits|
|`notify()`|Wakes up one waiting thread|
|`notifyAll()`|Wakes up all waiting threads|

### Example:

```java
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait();    // waits
    obj.notify();  // notifies
}
```

---

## 🔹 10. **Deadlock**

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting on each other.

### Example:

```java
Thread-1: locks A → waits for B  
Thread-2: locks B → waits for A
```

💡 Solution: Always acquire locks in a fixed order.

---

## 🔹 11. **Thread Pooling (Executor Framework)**

Creating too many threads wastes resources. **Thread Pool** reuses a limited number of threads.

### Using `ExecutorService`:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Thread from pool");
});
executor.shutdown();
```

---

## 🔹 12. **Volatile Keyword**

Used to mark a variable as **modified by multiple threads**. Prevents caching, always reads from main memory.

```java
volatile boolean running = true;
```

---

## 🔹 13. **Daemon Threads**

**Daemon Thread:** A thread that runs in the background and does not prevent the JVM from exiting. It dies automatically when the main thread or other user (non-daemon) threads finish.

### 🔹 Examples of Daemon Threads:

- **Garbage Collector**
    
- **Background logging**
    
- **Timer services**
    
- **Auto-save tasks**
    

---

### 🔹 Key Points:

|Feature|Details|
|---|---|
|Lifecycle|Dies when all user threads are finished|
|Creation|Use `Thread t = new Thread();`|
|Set as daemon|`t.setDaemon(true);` → **before** calling `t.start()`|
|Check if daemon|`t.isDaemon()` returns `true` or `false`|
|JVM behavior|JVM exits when only daemon threads are running|

---

### 🔹 Syntax:

```java
Thread t = new Thread();
t.setDaemon(true); // must be before start()
t.start();
```

---

### 🔹 Example Code:

```java
class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Daemon Thread running: " + i);
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch(Exception e) {}
        }
    }
}

public class DaemonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread t = new MyDaemonThread();
        t.setDaemon(true); // set as daemon before start
        t.start();
		
        // Main thread
        System.out.println("Main thread sleeping...");
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch(Exception e) {}
        System.out.println("Main thread finished");
    }
}
```

**Output (may not print all daemon thread lines):**

arduino

Copy code

`Main thread sleeping... Daemon Thread running: 0 Daemon Thread running: 1 Main thread finished`

---

### 🔴 Common Mistakes:

1. ❌ Calling `setDaemon(true)` **after** `start()` – results in **`IllegalThreadStateException`**.
    
2. ❌ Assuming daemon threads will always finish – they **may not**.
    

---

### 🔹 Daemon vs User Thread

|Feature|Daemon Thread|User Thread|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Background services|Main logic of the application|
|JVM waits?|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Termination|Automatically when no user thread|Must finish or be stopped manually|

---

### 🧠 Remember:

- Use daemon threads for **non-critical** tasks.
    
- Always set daemon **before starting** the thread.
    
- Main thread sleeping gives daemon time to work.

---

## 🔹 14. **Thread-safe Collections**

For multithreaded applications:

- `Vector` (thread-safe)
    
- `Collections.synchronizedList()`
    
- `ConcurrentHashMap` (more efficient)
    

---

## 🔹 15. **Advanced Java Concurrency API**

From `java.util.concurrent` package:

|Class / Interface|Use|
|---|---|
|`Executor`, `ExecutorService`|Manage thread pools|
|`Future`, `Callable`|Return results from threads|
|`Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`|Thread coordination|
|`ReentrantLock`|Advanced locking mechanism|
|`CyclicBarrier`|Sync threads at a common point|
|`BlockingQueue`|Safe queue for threads|

---

## 🔹 16. **Callable vs Runnable**

|Feature|Runnable|Callable|
|---|---|---|
|Return|No return value|Returns value|
|Exception|Cannot throw checked|Can throw checked|
|Interface|Runnable|Callable<T>|

---

## 🔹 17. **Best Practices in Multithreading**

- Use **thread pool** instead of creating threads manually
    
- Avoid **shared mutable state**
    
- Use **synchronization** wisely (too much causes bottlenecks)
    
- Avoid **deadlocks** – lock ordering or timeout
    
- Prefer **high-level concurrency tools** (`ExecutorService`, `Atomic`, etc.)
    

---

## ✅ Summary

Multithreading is powerful but **complex**. Start with basics → practice creating threads → learn synchronization → explore concurrent utilities.
