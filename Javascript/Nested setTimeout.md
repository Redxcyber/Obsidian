### 🧠 First, what is `setTimeout`?

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello!");
}, 1000); // runs after 1 second (1000 ms)
```

It runs **once**, after a delay.

---

### ✅ Now what is **nested `setTimeout`**?

"Nested" just means:

> `setTimeout` **calls itself again** from **inside itself**, after it finishes running.

---

### 💡 Here's a super simple example:

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello");

  // Schedule the same function again after 2 seconds
  setTimeout(sayHello, 2000);
}

// First call to start the loop
setTimeout(sayHello, 2000);
```

### 🔁 What happens here?

- After 2 seconds: `sayHello()` runs → prints `"Hello"`
    
- Inside `sayHello()`, we tell it to run **again after 2 seconds**
    
- So it keeps repeating:
    
    - Wait → Run → Wait → Run → ...
    

---

### 🔄 Why use nested setTimeout?

Nested `setTimeout` gives you **control** to:

1. **Change delay between runs** dynamically
    
2. Make sure the task is **finished** before scheduling the next one
    

---

### 🧪 Compare with setInterval

```js
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Tick");
}, 2000);
```

- This runs every 2 seconds, **even if** the previous run isn’t done.
    
- Can overlap if the task is slow.

### 🔧 Example: Nested setTimeout with dynamic delay

```js
let delay = 1000;

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");

  // Increase delay each time
  delay += 1000;

  setTimeout(greet, delay);
}

setTimeout(greet, delay);
```

👆 This prints:

```sh
Hello!   (after 1 sec)
Hello!   (after 2 sec)
Hello!   (after 3 sec)
...
```

### ✅ When should I use nested setTimeout?

- When task is **slow or unpredictable**
    
- When you want **custom delay logic**
    
- When you need to **adjust timing based on results**

### 🧠 Think of it like:

```txt
1. Do the task
2. Wait X time
3. Do the task again
4. Repeat
```
