## ðŸ§  Step-by-step Beginner Explanation

### âœ… 1. What is Lexical Environment?

When JavaScript runs your code, it keeps track of which variables exist **where**. This information is stored in something called a **Lexical Environment**.

You can think of it like:

> A box where all your variables and functions for the current block or function are kept.

```js
let a = 10;
function showA() {
  console.log(a); // gets "a" from its lexical environment (global here)
}
showA();
```

ðŸ“¦ `Lexical Environment` here = `{ a: 10, showA: function }`

---

### âœ… 2. Lexical Environment is nested

Each function you write has access to:

- Its **own variables** (local scope)
    
- Variables from **where it was created** (outer scope)
    

```js
let phrase = "Hello";

function greet(name) {
  console.log(phrase + ", " + name);
}

greet("Pranav"); // "Hello, Pranav"
```

Here:

- `phrase` is in the **global environment**
    
- `name` is in the **greet functionâ€™s local environment**
    

When the `greet()` function runs, it looks for `phrase` in its own local variables. Not found? It looks **outside**, and finds it in the global scope.

### âœ… 3. What is a Closure?

> A **closure** is a function that "remembers" variables from the place where it was created â€” even if it runs later or somewhere else.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    return count++;
  };
}

let counter = makeCounter();

console.log(counter()); // 0
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

ðŸ§  **What's Happening?**

- `makeCounter()` runs and creates `count = 0`
    
- It returns a new function (we call that `counter`)
    
- Even though `makeCounter()` finished running, the returned function still remembers the variable `count` from its parent scope.
    
- Thatâ€™s a **closure**.
    

---

### âœ… 4. Closure is useful when:

- You want to **protect variables** from being accessed directly
    
- You want to **remember data** between function calls
    
- You want to create **private variables**
    

---

### âœ… 5. Real-life Example

Letâ€™s say you want to count how many times a user clicks a button:

js

Copy code

`function createClickCounter() {   let clickCount = 0;    return function () {     clickCount++;     console.log("Clicked", clickCount, "times");   }; }  let buttonClicked = createClickCounter();  buttonClicked(); // Clicked 1 times buttonClicked(); // Clicked 2 times`

âœ… Here, `clickCount` is a **private variable** that is remembered by the closure.

---

## TL;DR (Too Long Didnâ€™t Read)

- Every function gets a **Lexical Environment**, a box of variables.
    
- **Closures** are functions that remember their outer variables even if used elsewhere later.
    
- They are **extremely useful** in real-world apps to **store private data**, **build timers**, **create caches**, and more.
