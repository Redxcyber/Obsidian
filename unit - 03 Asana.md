### Maharishi Yoga Asanas

Maharishi Yoga Asanas are an essential component of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's approach to health, well-being, and spiritual development. They complement the practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) by promoting physical flexibility, mental relaxation, and inner peace, creating a foundation for a deeper meditation experience. These postures are specifically designed to balance the body, mind, and spirit, fostering holistic growth in every dimension of a person's life.
