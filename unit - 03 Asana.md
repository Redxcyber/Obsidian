## ➡️ Core Principles of Maharishi Yoga Asanas


### 1. **Natural and Effortless Movement**

- Maharishi Yoga Asanas use soft and natural body movements that feel easy and comfortable.
    
- The goal is not to force or strain the body, but to move gently and relax fully.
    
- These postures are meant to match the body’s natural rhythm, helping energy (called _prana_) move freely and smoothly.

### 2. **Preparation for Meditation**

- These yoga postures help the body and mind feel calm and balanced, which is important before doing meditation, especially _Transcendental Meditation (TM)_.
    
- They remove stress and tension from the body that could disturb deep rest during meditation.
    
- Maharishi believed that a relaxed body helps the mind stay quiet and focused, making it easier to experience _pure consciousness_ in meditation.

### 3. **Holistic Approach**

- Maharishi Yoga Asanas care for the whole person — the body, mind, emotions, and spirit.
    
- They improve physical health, clear the mind, balance emotions, and support spiritual growth.
    
- This practice connects the body, mind, and inner self, helping a person feel peaceful and making meditation more powerful.

### 4. **Breath Awareness**

- Breathing is very important in Maharishi Yoga Asanas.
    
- Deep and mindful breathing increases the flow of _prana_ (life energy) in the body.
    
- It also calms the nervous system and brings mental peace.
    
- When breathing is done with awareness during the asanas, it helps you stay present, think clearly, and meditate better.
