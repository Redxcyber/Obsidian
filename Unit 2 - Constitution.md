### **Parliament legislation in state field

In the Indian federal system, both the **Union** (Central) and **State** governments have powers to legislate on various subjects, which are divided into three lists under the **Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution**:

1. **Union List** â€“ subjects only Parliament can legislate on.
    
2. **State List** â€“ subjects only State Legislatures can legislate on.
    
3. **Concurrent List** â€“ both Parliament and State Legislatures can legislate, but central law prevails in case of conflict.

### **Central control over the state legislation**


Central control over State legislation is a key feature of India's **quasi-federal** structure.

    2. Withhold assent.
        
    3. Reserve the bill for the consideration of the **President** (especially if it clashes with Union law or is of national interest).
