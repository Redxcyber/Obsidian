### **Parliament legislation in state field

In the Indian federal system, both the **Union** (Central) and **State** governments have powers to legislate on various subjects, which are divided into three lists under the **Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution**:

1. **Union List** – subjects only Parliament can legislate on.
    
2. **State List** – subjects only State Legislatures can legislate on.
    
3. **Concurrent List** – both Parliament and State Legislatures can legislate, but central law prevails in case of conflict.
    

---

### ✅ Can **Parliament make laws on subjects in the State List**?

But there are **5 exceptional situations** where **Parliament can legislate on State subjects**:

---

### 🔶 1. **In the National Interest** – (Article 249)

- **Condition**: Rajya Sabha passes a resolution (with 2/3rd majority) that it is **necessary in the national interest**.
    
- **Effect**: Parliament can make laws on a **State List subject** for the **whole or any part of India**.
    
- **Duration**: 1 year (can be extended by 1 year at a time).
    

---

### 🔶 2. **During a National Emergency** – (Article 250)

- When a **National Emergency (Article 352)** is in operation, Parliament can make laws on **State List** subjects.
    
- **Laws remain in force** till **6 months after the emergency ends**.
    

---

### 🔶 3. **If Two or More States Request It** – (Article 252)

- When **two or more states** pass a resolution requesting Parliament to make a law on a State List subject.
    
- That law will apply only to those states (and others if they adopt it later).

### **Central control over the state legislation**


Central control over State legislation is a key feature of India's **quasi-federal** structure. Although states have autonomy in their own sphere (especially on subjects in the **State List**), the **Central Government and Parliament have several mechanisms to control or influence State legislation**.

---

### ✅ **Forms of Central Control Over State Legislation**

---

### 🔶 1. **Governor’s Assent (Article 200)**

- Every bill passed by the State Legislature must be sent to the **Governor** for assent.
    
- Governor has 4 options:
    
    1. Give assent.
        
    2. Withhold assent.
        
    3. Reserve the bill for the consideration of the **President** (especially if it clashes with Union law or is of national interest).
        
    4. Return the bill (if not a money bill) for reconsideration.
        

---

### 🔶 2. **Reservation for President’s Consideration (Article 201)**

- When the Governor **reserves a bill for the President**, the **President can:**
    
    - Give assent.
        
    - Withhold assent.
        
    - Direct the Governor to return it to the State Legislature.
        
- This gives the **Union executive final control** over such state legislation.
    

---

### 🔶 3. **Repugnancy with Central Laws (Article 254)**

- If a **State law** on a **Concurrent List** subject **conflicts with a Central law**, the **Central law prevails**.
    
- However, if:
    
    - The **State law is passed**, and
        
    - It gets **President’s assent**,  
        → Then **that State law prevails** in that state, even if it's inconsistent with a central law (unless Parliament later overrides it).
        

---

### 🔶 4. **Direction to States (Articles 256 & 257)**

- States must **ensure compliance with laws made by Parliament**.
    
- The **Centre can give directions** to states to ensure such compliance.
    

---

### 🔶 5. **Control During Emergency (Articles 250 & 356)**

- **National Emergency (Art 250):** Parliament can make laws on State subjects.
    
- **President’s Rule (Art 356):** Parliament or President can assume state legislative functions.
    

---

### 🔶 6. **Inter-State Council / Zonal Councils Recommendations**

- Though not direct control, these bodies help align state legislation with national policies through **cooperative federalism**.
    

---

### 🔶 7. **Financial Control (Indirect Legislative Influence)**

- **Grants-in-aid** and funds from the Centre often come with **conditions**, influencing state legislative priorities.
    
- Example: Centrally sponsored schemes like PM Awas Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission.
