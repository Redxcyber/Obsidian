### **Central control over the state legislation**


Central control over State legislation is a key feature of India's **quasi-federal** structure. Although states have autonomy in their own sphere (especially on subjects in the **State List**), the **Central Government and Parliament have several mechanisms to control or influence State legislation**.

---

### ✅ **Forms of Central Control Over State Legislation**

---

### 🔶 1. **Governor’s Assent (Article 200)**

- Every bill passed by the State Legislature must be sent to the **Governor** for assent.
    
- Governor has 4 options:
    
    1. Give assent.
        
    2. Withhold assent.
        
    3. Reserve the bill for the consideration of the **President** (especially if it clashes with Union law or is of national interest).
        
    4. Return the bill (if not a money bill) for reconsideration.
        

---

### 🔶 2. **Reservation for President’s Consideration (Article 201)**

- When the Governor **reserves a bill for the President**, the **President can:**
    
    - Give assent.
        
    - Withhold assent.
        
    - Direct the Governor to return it to the State Legislature.
        
- This gives the **Union executive final control** over such state legislation.
    

---

### 🔶 3. **Repugnancy with Central Laws (Article 254)**

- If a **State law** on a **Concurrent List** subject **conflicts with a Central law**, the **Central law prevails**.
    
- However, if:
    
    - The **State law is passed**, and
        
    - It gets **President’s assent**,  
        → Then **that State law prevails** in that state, even if it's inconsistent with a central law (unless Parliament later overrides it).
        

---

### 🔶 4. **Direction to States (Articles 256 & 257)**

- States must **ensure compliance with laws made by Parliament**.
    
- The **Centre can give directions** to states to ensure such compliance.
    

---

### 🔶 5. **Control During Emergency (Articles 250 & 356)**

- **National Emergency (Art 250):** Parliament can make laws on State subjects.
    
- **President’s Rule (Art 356):** Parliament or President can assume state legislative functions.
    

---

### 🔶 6. **Inter-State Council / Zonal Councils Recommendations**

- Though not direct control, these bodies help align state legislation with national policies through **cooperative federalism**.
    

---

### 🔶 7. **Financial Control (Indirect Legislative Influence)**

- **Grants-in-aid** and funds from the Centre often come with **conditions**, influencing state legislative priorities.
    
- Example: Centrally sponsored schemes like PM Awas Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission.
