When checking whether a number n is prime, we use n\sqrt{n}nâ€‹ as an optimization to reduce the number of checks. The logic behind this is based on the **properties of factors**:

### **Key Idea: Factors Appear in Pairs**

Every composite number n can be expressed as the product of two factors:

$$
n=aÃ—b
$$

If both a and b were greater than sqrt(n) , their product would be greater than n, which is a contradiction. Therefore, **at least one of the factors must be â‰¤ sqrt(n) .

#DOUBT **- what is Factor pair ??**

A factor pair of a number n is **two numbers that multiply together to give n**.

For example, let's take n=36.  

The factor pairs of 36 are:
	1Ã—36=36 
	2Ã—18=36
	3Ã—6=36
	4Ã—9=36
	6Ã—6=36
Once we reach **6 Ã— 6**, the factors **start repeating** in reverse:
	9Ã—4=36
	12Ã—3=36
	18Ã—2=36
	36Ã—1=36

So, after we reach 6, we donâ€™t need to check **9, 12, 18, 36**, because they already appeared before (just reversed).

That means:  
ðŸ‘‰ **If we donâ€™t find a factor before sqrt(36) = 6, we wonâ€™t find one later either!**

---

### **Why Does This Matter for Prime Numbers?**

A prime number **has no factors** except **1 and itself**.

#### **Example: Checking if 37 is Prime**

We want to check if 37 is prime.  
Instead of checking all numbers from **2 to 36**, we **only check up to**
$$
\sqrt{37} â‰ˆ6
$$
So, we check: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**

- None of them divide 37.
- That means **no larger number will divide 37 either** (because its pair would be smaller than 6).
- Since we found **no factors**, **37 is prime**.

---

### **Final Answer: Why Use sqrt{n} â€‹?**

âœ… **If a number n has a factor larger than sqrt(n), then its pair factor must be smaller than sqrt(n).**  
âœ… **If no number â‰¤ sqrt(n)â€‹ divides n, then no number will.**  
âœ… **This makes checking for primes much faster!**
