```java
int temp;  
for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){  
    if(i==0){  
        temp = arr[i];  
    }else{  
        arr[i-1] = arr[i];  
    }
}  
arr[arr.length-1] = temp;
```

When you **declare a variable outside a loop** but **initialize it inside the loop**, the Java compiler cannot guarantee that the variable will be initialized in all scenarios. Because of this, you might get a **warning** or an error like **"variable might not have been initialized."**

---

### Example Code:

```java
int temp; // Variable is declared but not initialized.

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        temp = arr[i]; // Initialized on the first iteration.
    } else {
        arr[i - 1] = arr[i]; // Shifting elements.
    }
}

arr[arr.length - 1] = temp; // Using temp outside the loop.
```

Even though **logically**, you know that `temp` will always be initialized when `i == 0`, the **Java compiler does not analyze the logic of your loop deeply**. It only checks if there is **any possibility** that `temp` might remain uninitialized. If there is even a slight chance, it will throw a warning or an error.

---

### Solution: Initialize `temp` with a Default Value

To fix this, you can **initialize the variable with a default value** when you declare it. This guarantees that `temp` will always have some value, regardless of what happens inside the loop.

#### Correct Code:

```java
int temp = 0; // Initialized with a default value.

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        temp = arr[i]; // Update temp on the first iteration.
    } else {
        arr[i - 1] = arr[i]; // Shift elements to the left.
    }
}

arr[arr.length - 1] = temp; // Use temp outside the loop.
```

---

### Why Does the Warning Occur?

The warning occurs because:

1. The **Java compiler cannot guarantee** that the `if (i == 0)` condition will always be true.
2. If the array length (`arr.length`) is `0`, the loop will not run at all, and `temp` will remain **uninitialized**.
3. When you try to use an uninitialized variable, Java throws a compile-time error or warning.

---

### How Does the Default Value Solve It?

By initializing `temp` with a default value (e.g., `int temp = 0;`), you make sure:

1. `temp` will always have a value, no matter what happens inside the loop.
2. The Java compiler no longer complains because it knows `temp` cannot remain uninitialized.

---

### Example Scenarios:

#### Without Default Initialization:

```java
int temp; // Warning: Variable not initialized.

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        temp = arr[i]; // Only initialized when i == 0.
    }
}

// If the loop doesn't run (e.g., arr.length == 0), temp remains uninitialized.
// This will cause a compile-time error:
System.out.println(temp);
```

#### With Default Initialization:

```java
int temp = 0; // No warning: temp is initialized with a default value.

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        temp = arr[i]; // Updated in the loop.
    }
}

// Even if the loop doesn't run, temp has the default value:
System.out.println(temp); // Prints: 0 (or whatever default value you choose).
```

---

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Always initialize variables** when declaring them if thereâ€™s a possibility they might remain uninitialized later.
    - Example: `int temp = 0;`
2. Java **requires all variables to be initialized before use**. If there's even a chance a variable won't be initialized, you'll get a warning or error.
3. Initializing variables with a **default value** ensures your code is safe and avoids compiler warnings.

### Real Example: Array Rotation

Your original code for rotating an array can be fixed by initializing `temp` with a default value:

```java
int temp = 0; // Default initialization.

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i == 0) {
        temp = arr[i]; // Assign first element to temp.
    } else {
        arr[i - 1] = arr[i]; // Shift elements to the left.
    }
}

arr[arr.length - 1] = temp; // Place the saved value at the end.
```
