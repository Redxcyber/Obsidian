### **Step-by-Step: How input works**

Letâ€™s say you have this code:

```
``java

Copy code

`Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  System.out.print("Enter an integer: "); if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {     int number = scanner.nextInt();     System.out.println("You entered: " + number); } else {     System.out.println("Not an integer."); }```
```

Now imagine the user types:

Copy code

`42`

---

### **What happens behind the scenes?**

1. **User types input:**  
    The user types `42` and hits Enter.  
    Now the **entire line** `"42\n"` is available in the input buffer.
    
2. **`scanner.hasNextInt()` checks the input:**
    
    - It looks at the next **token** (like a word) from the buffer **without consuming it**.
        
    - It checks: _"Is this token something I can convert to an integer?"_
        
    - In our case, `42` is valid, so `hasNextInt()` returns `true`.
        
3. **`scanner.nextInt()` reads the value:**
    
    - Now it **actually consumes** the token (removes `42` from the buffer),
        
    - Converts it to an `int`,
        
    - And returns it, which gets stored in the variable `number`.

### **Why `nextInt()` doesn't ask again:**

- Because `hasNextInt()` and `nextInt()` work on the **same line of input**.
    
- `hasNextInt()` only checks. `nextInt()` **reads**.
    
- If the input is invalid, and you don't handle it, it throws an exception.

### Bonus:

If you want to force asking again, you must use a loop:

java

Copy code

`while (!scanner.hasNextInt()) {     System.out.println("That's not an integer, try again:");     scanner.next(); // consume the invalid input } int number = scanner.nextInt(); // now it's safe`

Let me know if you'd like to see this in action with more complex input!
