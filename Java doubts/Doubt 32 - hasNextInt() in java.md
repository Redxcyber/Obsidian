### **Step-by-Step: How input works**

Let’s say you have this code:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
    int number = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
} else {
    System.out.println("Not an integer.");
}
```

Now imagine the user types:

```sh
42
```

---

### **What happens behind the scenes?**

1. **User types input:**  
    The user types `42` and hits Enter.  
    Now the **entire line** `"42\n"` is available in the input buffer.
    
2. **`scanner.hasNextInt()` checks the input:**
    
    - It looks at the next **token** (like a word) from the buffer **without consuming it**.
        
    - It checks: _"Is this token something I can convert to an integer?"_
        
    - In our case, `42` is valid, so `hasNextInt()` returns `true`.
        
3. **`scanner.nextInt()` reads the value:**
    
    - Now it **actually consumes** the token (removes `42` from the buffer),
        
    - Converts it to an `int`,
        
    - And returns it, which gets stored in the variable `number`.
        

---

### **Why `nextInt()` doesn't ask again:**

- Because `hasNextInt()` and `nextInt()` work on the **same line of input**.
    
- `hasNextInt()` only checks. `nextInt()` **reads**.
    
- If the input is invalid, and you don't handle it, it throws an exception.
    

---

### Bonus:

If you want to force asking again, you must use a loop:

```java
while (!scanner.hasNextInt()) {
    System.out.println("That's not an integer, try again:");
    scanner.next(); // consume the invalid input
}
int number = scanner.nextInt(); // now it's safe
```

---

Let's go **super deep** into how `Scanner.hasNextInt()` and `Scanner.nextInt()` work behind the scenes with the input buffer, tokens, and user input handling.

---

## 🧠 What is `Scanner` doing?

Java's `Scanner` reads input using **tokens**, which are chunks of data separated by whitespace (like spaces, tabs, newlines). So when a user types a line:

```sh
42 hello 99
```

These are three **tokens**:

- `"42"`
    
- `"hello"`
    
- `"99"`
    

---

## 🔍 `hasNextInt()` – Check Only

```java
scanner.hasNextInt();
```

### What does it do?

- It **peeks** at the next token.
    
- Tries to **parse it into an `int`**.
    
- Returns:
    
    - `true` if parsing succeeds (i.e., it _can_ be turned into an integer).
        
    - `false` if not (e.g., it's a word or float or symbol).
        

### ❗Important:

- It **does NOT consume or remove** the token from the buffer.
    
- It’s just a check. Nothing is read or stored yet.
    

---

## ✅ `nextInt()` – Actually Reads

```java
int number = scanner.nextInt();
```

### What does it do?

- It reads the **next token** from the input.
    
- Parses it into an `int`.
    
- **Consumes** it (removes it from the input buffer).
    
- Assigns it to your variable.
    

### What if it's not a valid int?

If the next token is _not_ an integer (e.g., the user types `"hello"`), `nextInt()` throws an exception:

```sh
InputMismatchException
```

That's why we **always** pair it with `hasNextInt()` first.

---

## 🔁 Why it doesn't ask again

Here’s your question:

> Why doesn't `scanner.nextInt()` ask for input again if invalid?

### Answer:

Because Java doesn’t automatically re-prompt. Once you type something and press Enter, your **entire line** goes into the input buffer.

- `Scanner` works **on the buffer**, not directly with the keyboard.
    
- It only reads what’s already typed.
    
- It won’t re-ask unless **you code it** with a loop.
    

---

## 📦 Think of it like this:

Imagine input like a box of words you type:

Copy code

`42 hello 99`

|Token #|Token|Is it int?|
|---|---|---|
|1|"42"|✅ Yes|
|2|"hello"|❌ No|
|3|"99"|✅ Yes|

### Flow:

1. `hasNextInt()` → checks the next token (e.g., "42"), returns true
    
2. `nextInt()` → reads "42", removes it, assigns to variable
    
3. Next time, next token is now "hello"
    

---

## 🔁 To ask again until it's valid:

You need a loop to keep checking until input is valid:

java

Copy code

`Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); int number;  while (true) {     System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");     if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {         number = scanner.nextInt(); // read and assign         break; // input is valid, exit loop     } else {         System.out.println("That's not a valid integer!");         scanner.next(); // consume the invalid token (like "hello")     } } System.out.println("You entered: " + number);`

---

## 🎯 Summary

|Method|What it does|Consumes Input?|
|---|---|---|
|`hasNextInt()`|Checks next token: _"Is it an int?"_|❌ No|
|`nextInt()`|Reads and returns the next int token|✅ Yes|
|`scanner.next()`|Reads next token (as String), skips it|✅ Yes|
